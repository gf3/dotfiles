# Installation

## Prerequisites

* Git (1.7+)
* Mercurial (1.6+)
* Ruby (1.9 recommended) and RubyGems
* Vim (7.3+ with +ruby, I recommend [this formula](https://github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/blob/master/duplicates/vim.rb))
* Tree

Optional, but recommended:

* ZSH
* [RVM](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)
* [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) (OS X only)

## Bootstrapper

The bootstrapper depends on three things: ruby, rake, and bundler. Assuming you
have ruby and ruby gems installed on your system: `gem install rake bundler`.

**Note:** if using RVM, be sure to use the system ruby before installing.

Then:

    zsh < <( curl https://raw.github.com/gf3/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh )

Don't worry, all your old files will be backed up!

## Stay Updated

Run the bootstrapper again!

    ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh



# Vim

Overview of my vim setup. Sensible defaults!

## Mappings

Reference to vim mappings.

### General

* `,c` Toggle invisibles.
* `,ls` Show buffers (same as `:buffers`).
* `,n` Toggle NERD Tree file explorer.
* `,p` Toggle paste mode.
* `,qs` Toggle search highlight.
* `,qq` Close Quickfix window (think Ack.vim).
* `,rp` Toggle RainbowParenthesis.
* `,ss` Strip all trailing whitespace in buffer.
* `,tl` Toggle Taglist Plus.
* `,W` Sudo write!
* `Y` Yank from cursor to end of line (same as `y$`).
* `,]` Indent current block.
* `,[` Outdent current block.
* `,⏎` Insert newline.
* `'` Actually calls <code>`</code> for better mark jumping (line + column).

As well `↑`, `↓`, `⏎`, and `⎋` may be used in completions menus. `<PageUp>` and `<PageDown>` work in both insert and command mode.

### Splits

* `+` Increase split size.
* `-` Decrease split size.
* `^j` Go to split below.
* `^k` Go to split above.
* `^h` Go to split left.
* `^l` Go to split right.

### Markdow

* `,mp` Preview markdown buffer with Github styles.
* `,mf` Render markdown buffer to html in a file.
* `,mt` Render markdown buffer to html in a tab.

## Commands

* `:W` Alias to `:w` because I'm always typing it.

`<Tab>`.
